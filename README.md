# Getting Started with Driver Location App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is a small example app where we are going to build a google maps showing the driver locations. Another, feature is that when clicked on the driver we are to pop up a modal with the driver infomation.

## Bring up the application inside the container

This application is built with docker. I added docker-compose to easily build the containers. 
In order to build the app with a quick one line command. Use the command below. If you want to build the image then 
later run the image in two separate commands you may use the docker commands.

`docker-compose up`

## Build the docker image

If you want to tag and build the image you may run the following command. If you already ran `docker-compose up`
you do not need to run the two commands below.

`docker build -t 510carlos/driver-locations:v1 .`

## Run the docker image 

Now that the docker image is built we can now run the image.

`docker run -d -p 8080:8080 510carlos/driver-locations:v1`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
